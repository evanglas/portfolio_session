  "aboutMe": "I am a licensed galactic space penguin with 20 years in the interstellar fish trade. I have successfully commandeered 200+ missions across 20+ solar systems, achieving 300+ pesos in revenue. As someone with a passion for interspecies leadership and a passion to provide the best service to my loyal customers, I approach each day with a unique sense of purpose and pride. Following the conclusion of my most recent Marsian trout expedition, I will be seeking new opportunities in the shellfish transport sector.",
